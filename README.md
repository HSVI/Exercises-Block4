**Exercise 1 (Guessing Game)** . Write a program in **both R and Python** that plays a guessing game. The program should generate a random integer number between 1 and 100. Then it should keep asking the user to guess the number, and give feedback after each trial whether the given number is bigger or smaller than the hidden one. The program should terminate when the user guesses the correct hidden number. Use seeding to randomize the choice of the hidden number. Use appropriate control structures such as looks and if statements.
